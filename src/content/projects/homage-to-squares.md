This interactive web application allows users to create dynamic color compositions through hand and face gestures, inspired by Josef Albers' Homage to the Square. Using ML5.js, the software analyzes real-time movement and translates it into square-based artworks. Through this experience, users explore the interaction of colors and how they influence perception—echoing Albers’ color theory. The project is influenced by [Play a Kandinsky](/https://artsandculture.google.com/experiment/play-a-kandinsky/sgF5ivv105ukhA).
