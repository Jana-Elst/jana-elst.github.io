For my Creative Coding course, we had to turn a personal story into an interactive website using GSAP.

I chose to tell the story of the pandemic, one of the most impactful times of my life. I had just moved into a dorm, finished my first exames at the university and tried to make new friends. Then, suddenly, everything shut down. For the next two years, my entire world moved online.

It was a strange and lonely time, and making friends felt almost impossible. But somehow, in the middle of all that chaos, I found an amazing group of friends. We connected because we were all going through the same thing together. I'm incredibly grateful I met them. This website is my way of telling that story.

I built this using only the free features of GSAP that were available back then.

*The story is written in Dutch for now, but I hope to add an English version one day!*
