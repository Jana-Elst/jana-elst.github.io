## Concept
A dining experience designed for vegetarians with iron deficiency, La Cuisine du Sang redefines sustainable eating by serving carefully prepared blood-based dishes. Ethically sourced from dedicated meat-eaters, the donated blood undergoes rigorous testing to ensure safety for both donors and diners.

The interactive website engages visitors with a playful eligibility test to determine if they can donate blood, featuring fun interactions like dragging food into a mouth to indicate eating habits or marking a loyalty card with kisses to track recent partners. Donors are rewarded with an exclusive gourmet dining experience, ensuring their iron levels are replenished with a meat-rich feast.
