description: During the summer holidays, in between my work as a student worker. I experimented with pop-up windows. This are some of my experiments. I call them 'playfull windows'.

## the first experiment
My first experiment was all about populating my screen with multiple, moving pop-up windows. I managed to get it working, but closing all the individual windows afterwards was a pain. Nevertheless, the end result was quite satisfying! I love how a simple concept can evolve into something beautiful and unexpected.

## the second experiment
Since I could already create and move windows, the next logical step was to play with their size. I developed a new animation where the windows would grow and shrink instead of moving. The idea seemed basic, but the execution was harder than I anticipated. Chrome crashed with every attempt because the resizing frame rate was too high. After slowing it down, I created a delightful "pop-up window dance."

## the silly color picker
For my next project, I asked myself, "What if I could connect a different color to each specific browser width?" I implemented the idea and created a fun, whimsical color picker that changes color as you resize the window.

This project isn't on GitHub yet. But you can follow the progress on my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17854313268470251/).
