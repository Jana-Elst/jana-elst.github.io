title: Red Cross
description: A marketing campaign for Red Cross Flanders built on a single, unsettling question. 'What if we run out of donors?' Instead of just asking them to donate, I confronted them with the alternative, a future where we might be forced to buy what is now freely given.

The campaign is designed to guide students through a seamless journey, bringing the 'what if' scenario to life through the following stages:

## Offline awareness
The campaign would launch with posters in student areas. These posters are designed to spark curiosity by posing the campaign's central question and afterward directing viewers to the campaign website.

To amplify the message in an unexpected setting, the plan includes partnering with local supermarkets. A single shelf in a busy aisle would be left completely empty, marked only by a sign reading: "Sorry, product is out of stock. More info: ..." This guerilla tactic is designed to disrupt a daily routine, creating a powerful visual of scarcity that makes the need for donors tangible and immediate.

## Campaign website
The campaign website would be used as a central hub. The website would guide potential donors through the process. Instead of a standard FAQ, it answers the questions and uncertainties of first-time donors using a compelling storytelling approach. The tone is intentionally bold and unconventional, matching the campaign's provocative nature.

## Online engagement
The campaign's core idea would culminate in a unique post-donation experience. Their will be an interactive photobooth where donors could place themselves inside stylised product packaging.

The experience would generate the donor's photo and a unique personal link. With a clear call-to-action, donors would be encouraged to post their new picture directly to their socials, accompanied by their special link. This link will direct their friends to a custom version of the campaign site featuring the donor in the header image.
