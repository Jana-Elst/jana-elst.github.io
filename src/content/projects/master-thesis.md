This project focused on designing an inclusive, sensory-based workshop for visitors with non-congenital brain injuries and elderly residents in care centres at the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium (KMSKB). The goal was to create a "phygital" (physical + digital) tool that enhances the museum experience by engaging multiple senses, offering an accessible and enriching interaction with art.

## research
The design process followed the Double Diamond methodology, incorporating insights from desk research, field observations, and consultations with stakeholders. Key goals focused on enabling participants to express themselves, fostering emotional connections through art, and providing shared experiences. After generating several concepts, the "Sensory Palette" concept was chosen for its innovative approach, combining tactile, visual, auditory, and olfactory experiences.

## prototypes
Both physical (art cubes with NFC tags) and digital prototypes (app and projection system) were developed. The prototypes were tested and refined based on user feedback, with an emphasis on making the experience intuitive and enjoyable. The new workshop format was praised for its variety and engagement, allowing participants to interact with art in novel ways.

## outcome
The final product is an interactive workshop where participants explore art through various sensory elements. Itâ€™s designed to foster emotional connections, self-expression, and social interaction, making art more accessible for elderly individuals in care settings.
