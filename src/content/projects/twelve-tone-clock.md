This "clock" transforms time into sound. It is based on the principles of dodecaphony (twelve-tone music). Each hour and minute corresponds to a note in a twelve-tone series. The sounds are visualized as dynamic colors, Inspired by Scriabin’s synesthetic "clavier à lumières". The clock evolves continuously, with transformations applied to the tone series. every moment will sound different. At quarter-hour intervals, layered sounds build tension to mark significant time shifts.

Users can manipulate time by adjusting tempo and note sequences, so the clock becomes an interactive audiovisual immersive experience.
